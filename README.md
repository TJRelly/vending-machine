# React Router Vending Machine

## Overview

This project showcases my proficiency in React and React Router by building an interactive vending machine application. The goal was to demonstrate my ability to create a multi-page application using React Router for seamless navigation between components without starter code. 

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Routing**: Implemented React Router to manage navigation between different components, enhancing the user experience with a single-page application feel.
- **Component Architecture**: Developed a clean and modular component structure, featuring:
  - **VendingMachine Component**: Serves as the main page, displaying a list of available snacks.
  - **Snack Components**: Created multiple snack components, each representing a different snack item, accessible through the VendingMachine component.
- **URL State Management**: Each snack item in the vending machine updates the URL dynamically when clicked, allowing direct access to specific snack components via the browserâ€™s address bar.
- **User Navigation**: Provided intuitive navigation by allowing users to return to the main VendingMachine page from any snack component, ensuring a smooth user flow.

## Technical Highlights

- **React Router DOM**: Leveraged React Router DOM to create a seamless, single-page application experience with client-side routing.
- **Stateful Components**: Managed component state effectively to render different snack options and handle user interactions.
- **Focus on Functionality**: Prioritized full functionality of the application before applying any styling, following best practices in software development.

## Installation and Setup

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd vending-machine
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Technology Stack

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces, focusing on reusable components.
- **React Router DOM**: Library for handling dynamic routing in React applications.

## Conclusion

This project exemplifies my ability to build complex, interactive React applications with a focus on component architecture, state management, and dynamic routing. By completing this project without starter code, I demonstrated my problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of React and React Router.
